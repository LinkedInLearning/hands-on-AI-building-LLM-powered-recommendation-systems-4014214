## Course Description

<p>Get a technically grounded overview of how to start building the next generation of intelligent recommender systems. Moving beyond traditional algorithms, this course shows you how to immediately enhance existing systems by applying AI-powered techniques for embedding generation, semantic reranking, cold start mitigation, and more. Instructor Rishabha Misra outlines the essentials of designing sophisticated, GenAI-native architectures that enable dynamic experiences like conversational search and multimodal recommendations. An ideal fit for software engineers, data scientists, AI and ML engineers, and technical product managers, this course focuses on robust evaluation, teaching you how to measure for quality and fairness and ensure factual accuracy through patterns like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). By the end of this course, you’ll be prepared to design, evaluate, and operationalize effective and responsible GenAI recommender systems in a production environment.</p>

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
